In 2010, the Wikileaks organization approached three news outlets – _The New York Times_, the British newspaper _The Guardian_ and the German _Der Spiegel_ – with a trove of military dispatches that were later revealed to be [leaked by the whistleblower soldier Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning). This was the second of the big revelations from Wikileaks, following the earlier [Collateral Murder](https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org/) release in April 2010 of cockpit footage from a US military helicopter that strafed a crowd in Iraq including Reuters journalists. It was later followed by a [leak of US Diplomatic cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak) sent within the US State Department.
