One of my personal little hobbies has been to take a photo of the clear blue sky and post it to Instagram with no other context or explanation. I find it soothing, but I have fallen out of using it since I no longer use Instagram. So, I decided to instead collect all of the images here! Click on any image to view it in its original size and scale.

I also wrote an article in _The Atlantic_ [explaining the whole thing with some possible artistic antecedents]({% post_url published/2016-03-04-instagram-sky %}) if you'd prefer an more in-depth explanation.
